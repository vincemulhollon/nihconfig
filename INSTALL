INSTALL

One of many deployment possibilties taking advantage of git's branching and merging abilities:

git clone gitolite@blah.blah.blah:nih /usr/local/etc/nih-global
cd /usr/local/etc/nih-global
git branch global (if it somehow doesn't exit)
git checkout global
git push --set-upstream origin global

git clone gitolite@blah.blah.blah:nih /usr/local/etc/nih-freebsd
cd /usr/local/etc/nih-freebsd
git branch freebsd (if it somehow doesn't exit)
git checkout freebsd
git push --set-upstream origin freebsd

git clone gitolite@blah.blah.blah:nih /usr/local/etc/nih-vince.mulhollon.com
cd /usr/local/etc/nih-vince.mulhollon.com
git branch vince.mulhollon.com
git checkout vince.mulhollon.com
git push --set-upstream origin vince.mulhollon.com

Each branch needs an edited NIHROOTDIR and probably NIHLOG edited in the top level nih file.
Each branch will need substantial editing of the run script and modules added

Somewhere, probably in roots homedir, create an executable shell script

#!/bin/bash

/usr/local/etc/nih-global/nih
/usr/local/etc/nih-freebsd/nih
/usr/local/etc/nih-$HOSTNAME/nih

Personally, I keep most of my modules in git branch master, and keep little more than run files in the branches.

There is a constant tension between making multiple short simple modules, like a ldap-freebsd and a ldap-debian, vs making a long concatenated script that mostly wraps the shorter modules mentioned into giant "if ostype = xxx" stanzas, vs making really complicated scripts that figure out what to do based on OS and situation, line by line.
